Yo, I'm Donovan. I currently am occupied by school but I will do some stuff on here occasionally.
If you need me you can email me at donovanmdiaz@gmail.com or message me on Discord at rice#7788.

In my free time I usually play..
- Roblox (Depends on the game whether I play casually or competitively.)
- Rainbow Six Siege (Casually)
- CSGO (Kinda gray between playing competitively and casually.)
- Team Fortress 2 (Definetly play casually. Competitive TF2 is a nightmare.)

And some others that I can't remember the names of.

Whenever I am eating I prefer...
- Cheeseburgers
- Chicken (Wings, Strips, Nuggets, Whatever.)
- Grilled Cheese Sandwiches
- Anything that is Italian

I especially eat these things when the only other things on the menu are...
- Fish that isnt Cod or Salmon (The only I've tried and enjoyed.)
- The majority of salads
- Noodles that smell really fishy to the extent that I gag
